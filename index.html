      <h2>Who was XXXTENTACION?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy</strong>, known professionally as
        <strong>XXXTentacion</strong>. and commonly referred to as simply
        <strong>X</strong>, was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter.
        <br />
        <br />
        Though a controversial figure due to his widely publicized legal
        troubles, <strong>XXXTentacion</strong> gained a cult following among
        his young fanbase during his short career with his depression- and
        alienation-themed music.
        <br />
        <br />
        Critics and fans often credit him for his musical versatility, with his
        music exploring emo, drill, trap, lo-fi, indie rock, nu metal, hip hop,
        R&B, and punk rock. He is considered to be a leading figure in the emo
        rap and SoundCloud rap genres which garnered mainstream attention during
        the mid-to-late 2010s, and is the bestselling emo rapper of all time.

      <h2>Raise of X</h2>
      <p>
        Born in <strong>Plantation, Florida</strong>,
        <strong>XXXTentacion</strong> spent most of his childhood in <strong></strong>Lauderhill</strong>.
        He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention
        center and soon started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013,
        employing styles and techniques that were unconventional in rap music
        such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals, drawing
        inspiration from third-wave emo and grunge. In 2014, he formed the
        underground collective <strong>Members Only</strong> and alongside other members of the
        collective soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap music
        scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s. <strong>XXXTentacion</strong>
        gained mainstream attention with the single "<i>Look at Me</i>". His debut
        album <i>17</i> (2017) is certified double-platinum in the US and reached
        number two on the <strong>Billboard 200</strong>. His second album <i>?</i> (2018) debuted at
        number one on the <strong>Billboard 200</strong> and is certified quadruple-platinum in
        the US. Its lead single, "<i>Sad!</i>", posthumously reached number one on the
        <strong>Billboard Hot 100</strong>, and had amassed more than <strong>1.3 billion views</strong> on
        YouTube and <strong>1.7 billion</strong> streams on <strong>Spotify</strong> by November 2021, as well as
        being certified <strong>Diamond</strong> by the RIAA in August 2021
